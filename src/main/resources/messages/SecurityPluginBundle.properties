### ds001 -> dfs001
dfs001.lookup-for-digest=Look up and replace with digest
dfs001.documentation=missing-or-latest-version-tag
dfs001.latest-tag=':latest' tag used\nWhen using image you should use a specific tag to avoid uncontrolled behavior when the image is updated.

### ds002 -> dfs002
dfs002.add-nobody-user=Add nobody user
dfs002.replace-root-with-nobody=Replace a user with nobody
dfs002.documentation=avoid-default-root-dynamic-user

dfs002.missing-user=User should be declared, often by default it is root\nRunning containers with 'root' user can lead to a container escape situation.
dfs002.arg-in-user=User should be static. Dynamic user assignment can be overridden to root, risking container escape.
### ds011 -> dfs003
dfs003.remove-duplicated-alias=Remove duplicated alias

dsf004.documentation=multiple-cmd-entrypoint-instructions
dfs004.only-one-cmd-or-entrypoint=Multiple CMD or ENTRYPOINT instructions listed\nThere can only be one CMD and ENTRYPOINT instruction in a Dockerfile. If you list more than one instruction then only the last one will take effect.

dfs005.use-json-notation=Use JSON notation for CMD and ENTRYPOINT arguments to ensure proper parsing and avoid unexpected behavior.

dfs006.documentation=self-referencing-copy-from
dfs006.copy-referring-to-the-current-image=COPY '--from' referring to the current image\nCOPY '--from' should not mention the current FROM alias, since it is impossible to copy from itself.
### ds004 -> dfs007
dfs007.replace-add-with-copy=Replace ADD with COPY
dfs007.documentation=add-instead-of-copy
dfs007.add-instead-copy=ADD instead of COPY\nYou should use COPY instead of ADD unless you want to extract a tar file.
### ds010 -> dfs008
dfs008.documentation=copy-multiple-arguments-slash
dfs008.use-slash-for-copy-args=COPY with more than two arguments not ending with slash\nWhen a COPY command has more than two arguments, the last one should end with a slash.
### ds026 -> dfs009
dfs009.remove-env-with-secret=Remove ENV with secret

dfs010.port-out-of-range=Exposed port {0} out of range\nUNIX ports outside the range 0-65535 are exposed.
### ds003 -> dfs011
dfs011.remove-dangerous-port-exposed=Remove dangerous port exposed
dfs011.documentation=port-22-exposed
dfs011.ssh-port-exposed=Port 22 exposed\nExposing port 22 might allow users to SSH into the container.
### ds021 -> dfs012
dfs012.remove-redundant-healthcheck=Remove redundant HEALTHCHECK
dfs012.documentation=multiple-healthcheck-defined
dfs012.only-one-healthcheck=Multiple HEALTHCHECK defined\nProviding more than one HEALTHCHECK instruction per stage is confusing and error-prone.
### ds020 -> dfs013
dfs013.replace-maintainer=Replace MAINTAINER with LABEL
dfs013.documentation=deprecated-maintainer-used
dfs013.no-maintainer=Deprecated MAINTAINER used\nMAINTAINER has been deprecated since Docker 1.13.0.
### ds030 -> dfs014

### ds032 -> dfs015
dfs015.documentation=avoid-using-apt
dfs015.apt-is-used=Do not use apt as it is meant to be an end-user tool, use apt-get or apt-cache instead.
### ds028 -> dfs016
dfs016.documentation=arg-variables-overridden

### ds022 -> dfs018
dfs018.documentation=no-dist-upgrade
dfs018.no-dist-upgrade=Package manager `dist-upgrade` used\nPackage manager `dist-upgrade` upgrades a major version so it doesn't make more sense in Dockerfile.
### ds017 -> dfs019
dfs019.documentation=purge-dnf-package-cache
dfs019.purge-dnf-package-cache='dnf clean all' missing\nCached package data should be cleaned after installation to reduce image size.
### ds019 -> dfs020
dfs020.documentation=use-package-manager-auto-confirm
dfs020.use-package-manager-auto-confirm=Package manager with missing '-y' to avoid manual input\nPackage manager calls should use the flag '-y' to avoid manual user input.

dfs021.documentation=update-and-install-single-run

### ds018 -> dfs025
dfs025.documentation=purge-zipper-cache
dfs025.purge-zipper-cache='zypper clean' missing\nThe layer and image size should be reduced by deleting unneeded caches after running zypper.
### ds013 -> dfs026
dfs026.documentation=standardise-remote-get
dfs026.standardise-remote-get=RUN using 'wget' and 'curl'\nAvoid using both 'wget' and 'curl' since these tools have the same effect.
### ds008 -> dfs027
dfs027.documentation=workdir-path-not-absolute
